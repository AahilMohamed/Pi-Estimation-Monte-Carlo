# π estimation using Monte Carlo simulations

## Overview
This project uses Monte Carlo simulations to produce a rough estimate on the value of π
A Monte Carlo simulation is essentially an algorithm that relies on repeated random samplings to arrive at meaningful numerical results.

## Process
In a canvas, a square of lenght 2R is drawn. Inscribed into the square is a circle of radius R, such that the circle rests nicely in the square.
Thus, the area of circle can be calculated by multiplying the area of the square by a certain constant, P.
> Area of Circle = P * 4R<sup>2</sup>.Result:
